<p>When you create a Iced Tea Labs account in order to access the Services (an “Account”), Iced Tea Labs will ask you to provide your email.  This information is necessary because we may send an email to the address you provide, as part of our ongoing efforts to detect and deter unauthorized or fraudulent use of or abuse of Services.  We may also use your registered email to provide you important information about Services.</p>
