Hi there!

My name is **Trinh Le** - a software engineer who is currently working at [@Lazada](https://www.lazada.vn/).
 
This blog is a space where I share my thoughts on anything (mostly technical, duh!).

The name "Iced Tea Labs" is inspired by memories of my university time. I was part of a team named "Iced Tea 09" and we participated in many competitions together. That's such a good time though.

I'm also really really into climbing recently. So there might be some post of me flexing with my climbing skill in the future then. 

If you want to find out more about my professional experiences, you can check out my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trinhlbk1991/) account.

Happy coding! ðŸ’»
