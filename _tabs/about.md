Hi there!

My name is **Trinh Le** - a software engineer who is currently working at [@Lazada](https://www.lazada.vn/).
 
This blog is a space where I share my thoughts on anything (mostly technical, duh!).

The name "Iced Tea Labs" is inspired by memories of my university time. I was part of a team named "Iced Tea 09" and we participated in many competitions together. That's such a good time though.

I also have a Google Play store also named ["Iced Tea Labs"](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=7059334999797832434) to publish some of my side projects:

I'm also really really into climbing recently. So there might be some post of me flexing with my climbing skill in the future then.

Happy coding! ðŸ’»
