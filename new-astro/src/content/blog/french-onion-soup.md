## The Art of Caramelization

The secret to a truly great French onion soup lies in the caramelization of the onions. This isn't a step to rush – those 40+ minutes of slow cooking transform raw, pungent onions into sweet, deeply flavored strands of pure umami.

## Choosing Your Onions

Yellow onions are the classic choice, offering the perfect balance of sweetness and depth. Some cooks like to add a red onion or two for extra complexity.

## The Right Cheese

While Gruyère is traditional, you can also use:

- **Comté** – A French cheese similar to Gruyère
- **Emmental** – More holes, slightly milder
- **Fontina** – Creamier texture when melted

Whatever you choose, make sure it's freshly grated for the best melt.

## Make It Ahead

This soup actually tastes better the next day! Make the soup base ahead and refrigerate. When ready to serve, reheat, ladle into bowls, add bread and cheese, then broil.
