## Picking the Perfect Avocado

Look for an avocado that yields slightly to gentle pressure. If it's rock hard, it needs a few days. If it's mushy, it's overripe.

> "Avocado toast is not just a trend, it's a lifestyle."

### How to Ripen Avocados Faster

If your avocado is hard as a rock, try these tricks:

1.  **Paper Bag Method**: Place it in a brown paper bag with a banana or apple. The ethylene gas will speed up ripening.
2.  **Warm Spot**: Keep it in a warm, sunny spot on your counter.

## Bread Matters

Use a sturdy bread like sourdough or whole grain to support the toppings. Soft white bread will get soggy.


## Topping Variations

Don't stop at just eggs! Here are some other great toppings:

- **Smoked Salmon**: For a luxurious, savory twist.
- **Feta Cheese**: Adds a salty, tangy kick.
- **Tomatoes**: Roasted cherry tomatoes add sweetness and acidity.
- **Bacon**: Crispy bacon bits for texture and flavor.

## The Secret to Creamy Avocado

Don't just slice it! Mashing the avocado with a fork allows you to incorporate seasoning directly into the spread.

*   Mash with lemon juice to prevent browning.
*   Add salt and pepper *before* spreading.
*   Leave it slightly chunky for texture.
