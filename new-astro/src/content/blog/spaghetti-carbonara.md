## The Real Deal

True Carbonara is a masterpiece of simplicity. It relies on the technique of tempering the eggs with the hot pasta to create a silky sauce without scrambling them.

## Guanciale vs. Pancetta vs. Bacon

- **Guanciale**: Cured pork jowl. The traditional choice. Rich and fatty.
- **Pancetta**: Cured pork belly. A great alternative.
- **Bacon**: Smoked pork belly. Adds a smoky flavor which isn't traditional but still delicious.
