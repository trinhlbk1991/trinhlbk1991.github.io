<h2>A - What is AngularJS?</h2>
AngularJS:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">-   is a client side JavaScript framework, can be added to an HTML page by a script tag!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">-   allows you to add interactivities to HTML files (extending HTML syntax with <strong>directives</strong>, binding data with <strong>expression</strong>,...)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">-   uses MVC pattern</p>

<h2>B - Why AngularJS?</h2>
If you're using JavaScript to build a dynamic website, AngularJS is a good choice because it:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">-   helps you organize your JavaScript code</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">-   helps create responsive website in a faster way</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">-   works well with jQuery</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">-   is easy to test</p>

<h2>C - AngularJS Components</h2>
In this part, I'll introduce briefly about AngularJS "must-know" components to help you have an overview about it.

All details will be posted in the following posts of this series.
<h3>1. Directives</h3>
A <strong>Directive</strong> is a marker on a HTML tag that tells Angular to run or reference some JavaScript code.

It extends HTML with custom attributes and elements.
<h3>2. Module</h3>
Module associates an AngularJS app with a specific region of HTML.

Module defines all the dependencies for your app.

Module makes your code readable, maintainable and testable.
<h3>3. Controller</h3>
Controller is where you define your app behavior, business logic with variables and functions.
<h3>4. Filter</h3>
Filter takes responsibility to format the value of an expression for display to the user without modifying the original value in scope.
<h3>5. Service</h3>
Service is used to encapsulate functionality that you want to reuse in multiple applications.

That's all for the introduction to AngularJS.

In the next post, I'll digg into Module details.
