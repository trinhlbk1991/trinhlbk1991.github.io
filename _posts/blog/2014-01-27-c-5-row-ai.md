<h2><strong>I. </strong><strong>Introdution</strong></h2>
This is my final project for the <em>Artificial intelligence </em>subject when I was in my university.

This is the 5 in a row game that you can play with the computer.
<h2><strong>II. </strong><strong>GUI and program's structure</strong></h2>

- Main functions of the game:
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>New game: as default, the computer will play first. In the next game, who lose will move first.</li>
	<li>Undo</li>
	<li>Save, Load.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
- The chess board is created by drawing many lines horizontally and vertically on the form.

- The images of the chess X and O are loaded from png files.

- All the buttons in this game actually are labels - which will change its background image base on the mouse state.

- The project has 2 classes:
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>CaroChess.cs:  contains all the variables, methods that handle game play logic, calculate the Heuristic function, decide the right move for computer, save and load game ...</li>
	<li>Graphic.cs: draw chess board and other components.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h2>III.AI Algorithm</h2>
-<strong><em> Evaluation function:</em></strong>

There are 2 score matrix:
<pre>public int[ ] DScore = new int[5] { 0, 1, 9, 81, 729 };//Defense score matrix
public int[ ] AScore = new int[5] { 0, 2, 18, 162, 1458 };//Attack score matrix</pre>
Once at a time, scan a block 5 cells in 4 directions: vertical, horizontal, slant up and slant down, count the number of chessman of each side and plus the score for blank cells when that block has only my chessman or the enemy's chessman.
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>If that block has n my chessman, plus DScore[n] score</li>
	<li>If that block has n enemy's chessman, plus AScore[n] score</li>
</ul>
</ul>
For example:
<table border="0" width="101" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="bottom" nowrap="nowrap" width="19"></td>
<td valign="bottom" nowrap="nowrap" width="21">x</td>
<td valign="bottom" nowrap="nowrap" width="21">x</td>
<td valign="bottom" nowrap="nowrap" width="22">x</td>
<td valign="bottom" nowrap="nowrap" width="19"></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
Two blank cells will get the score: Ascore[3] = 81

After scanning all the chessboard, the blank cells will be summed up all the scores.

Those scores will help us to specify the winning move for the computer.
